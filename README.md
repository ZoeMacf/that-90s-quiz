## User Experience (UX) 

### Initial Discussion

Users can test their knowledge of the 90's across many genres.


### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- I want to easily access the rules of the quiz.
- I want to be able to start the quiz with ease.
- I want to be able to view both the current score and a timer.
#### Returning Visitor Goals

- I would like to be able to see the correct answer if I choose wrong.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- I would like to be able to access and play the quiz across many devices with no performance or readability issues. 


## Design

This site has gone through three designs initially a simple blue themed design which was changed out for a black and pink neon approach however due to low contrast scores this was changed a final time to a theme similar to a Nintendo GameBoy to stick with the 90's theme. Images of all three designs will be included below. 

### Typography

For the main heading of this quiz the font family 'Oswald' was chosen, this font is quite similar to the font that was used on a GameBoy and as well as this, the simplistic look to it helped bring the elements together.

For the remainder of the site, the font family 'Press Start 2P' was chosen to help give the quiz the retro pixelated look of a classic GameBoy.

### That 90's Quiz Color Scheme

The colour scheme chosen uses the various green tones found on the original GameBoy screen, along with the grey to represent the device itself.

#### Timer

A timer was added to the quiz to give the user a time limit to answer the questions. If an answer is not choesen within this timeframe the buttons become disabled and the user has to skip the question.

### Future Implementations

In future I would like to have the questions and answers to shuffle on each restart. I would also like to allow the user to save their score and be able to access a high score section of the quiz. 

Allow the user to share their highscore on various social media accounts.
